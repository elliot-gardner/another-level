<h1>Another Level Gym</h1>
    <p>This is a minimum viable product website for a fictional gym. I wanted to make the website look modern and appealing. The site outlines some of the key details of the gym and encourages the user to contact/visit through the use of calls to action.
    </p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>.Existing Features
    *Navigation Bar
    * Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Gallery and Sign Up page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
    * This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.</p>

<h4>The landing page image</h4>
    <p></p>*The landing image immediately makes it clear that the website is related to fitness.</p>

<h4>Reasons to join section</h4>
    <p>*This section contains information targeted at both beginners and experienced gym users. This users will see the value of using this gym. This should encourage the user to visit the gym to achieve their fitness goals.
    </p>
<h4>The Footer</h4>
    <p>*The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Another Level Gym. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
    * The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media</p>

    </p>
<h3>Features Left to Implement</h3>
    <p>* The form is not currently functional
    * A modal would be very useful to provide positive confirmation that the form has been submitted.
    </p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
    <p>This site was tested as it was created. Rapid iterations with fixes applied as issues were identified. The site has been tested on Google chrome and Safari for iOS. 
    </p>

<h4>Validator Testing</h4>
    <p>* HTML
    * Errors have been idetntified using W3C validator: these are chiefly concerned with the bootstrap class names. Other issues include indentation recommendations.
    * CSS
    * No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) Validator: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css
    </p>

<h4>Unfixed Bugs</h4>
    <p>Functionally, there were no bugs identified, the navigation is fully functional and images & text display where they were set to. The issues in the HTML testing were not fixed due to time constraints.
    </p>

<h4>Deployment</h4>
    <p>This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)
    * The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    * In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
    * From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
    * Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

<h3>Credits</h4>
    <p>Many of the components used in my website were from the official bootstrap pages. I have modified these quite heavily at times though without bootstrap I would not have been able to deliver this website..
